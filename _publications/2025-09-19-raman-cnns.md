This paper provides an evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Raman spectroscopy. Key contributions:  

- **Clarifying inductive bias:** We examine how translational invariance, built into CNNs, influences spectral analysis.  
- **Pooling as a control knob:** By adjusting pooling, we tune the trade-off between robustness to peak shifts and sensitivity to subtle features.  
- **Learning with few labels:** Semi-supervised generative and contrastive approaches enable strong performance even with limited ground-truth data.  
- **Transferability:** Pretrained models can adapt rapidly to new mineral datasets, a capability highly relevant for planetary missions and remote field deployments.  

The results highlight how careful design choices make CNNs not just viable, but practical tools for **autonomous Raman instruments** operating in space and extreme environments.
