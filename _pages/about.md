I am a PhD candidate at **KU Leuven**, working on **deep learning** and **computer vision** for remote sensing @[EarthMapps](https://earthmapps.io/).  

My research focuses on combining computer vision, deep learning, and geospatial analysis with high-resolution UAV (drone) and satellite imagery, to design scalable, transferable and data-efficient models capable of producing spatially explicit estimates of vegetation dynamics, biomass evolution and biodiversity-related indicators.

This PhD is part of the **Leuven.AI** initiative and is jointly supervised across three research groups:  
- **EarthMapps** (Prof. Stef Lhermitte)  
- **Processing Speech and Images** (Prof. Matthew Blaschko and Prof. Toon Goedemé)  
- **Remote Sensing & Terrestrial Ecology** (Prof. Ben Somers)
