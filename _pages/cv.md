Education
======
* **Ph.D in AI and Computer Vision for Remote Sensing**, *KU Leuven*, 2025-2029 (expected)
* **MSc in Artificial Intelligence**, *KU Leuven*, 2021-2022 (Magna Cum Laude)
* **MSc in Electronics Engineering**, *ECAM Brussels*, 2019-2021 (Magna Cum Laude)
* **BSc in Electronics Engineering**, *ECAM Brussels*, 2015-2019 (Cum Laude)
* **Exchange Student** in Canada, *Université Laval*, 2019-2020

Work experience
======
* **Computer Vision / Machine Learning Engineer**, *Esko*, 2023-2025 
  * Segmentation refinement pipeline: Developed a Python-based pipeline to enhance the accuracy of segmentation masks generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), by combining Conditional Random Fields, CNN-based models (CascadePSP), and the Watershed algorithm.
  * Barcode detection and processing: Built a CNN-based (YOLO) solution for barcode detection, and custom vision algorithms for barcode quality assessment.
  * Layout analysis of artwork documents: Trained YOLO and fine-tuned LayoutLM models to detect and classify structures in digitized artwork documents, combining object detection with BERT-based semantic classification

* **Research Assistant in Construction Robotics**, *KU Leuven*, 2022-2023
  * Contributed to a project of building robots for shotcreting operations.
  
* **Master thesis student**, *KU Leuven*, 2021-2022
  * Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Renaud Detry, as part of the inVADER project led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I developed machine learning models for automated mineral identification from Raman spectroscopy data, supporting scientific autonomy in planetary exploration.
